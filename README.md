# Alex Parrott | Web Developer Site

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

You can view the deployed version at [www.alex-parrott.com](https://www.alex-parrott.com/).

## Check out my code!

This website is designed to double of an example of my own personal coding style. All code here is written by myself unless otherwise state below.

### Tech Stack

1. **Next.js** - framework with server side rendering out of the box.
2. **React.js** - frontend framework.
3. **Typescript** - JavaScript with added type checking.
4. **Styled Components** - CSS in JS library.

These were selected in order to demonstrate use of my personal tech preferences.

### Demo Apps

There are a a couple of little mini apps integrated into this site.

#### Interactive CV

This was built using the `react-slider` library.

#### Skills Searcher

This is put together using a combination of `react-table` and `react-autosuggest`.
