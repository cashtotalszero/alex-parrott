# Alex Parrott | Web Developer Site

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

You can view the deployed version at [www.alex-parrott.com](https://www.alex-parrott.com/).

## Check out my code!

This website is designed to double of an example of my own personal coding style. All code here is written by myself unless otherwise state below.

### Tech Stack

1. **Next.js** - framework with server side rendering out of the box.
2. **React.js** - frontend framework.
3. **Redux** - app state container.
4. **Styled Components** - CSS in JS library.
5. **MongoDB** - NoSQL Database.

These were selected in order to demonstrate use of my personal tech preferences.

#### Code Style

I am using a personalised ESLint config based on the AirBnB style guide. I prefer stricter rules to ensure that the site is both **response** and **accessible**.

### Demo Apps

There are a several little mini apps integrated into this site.

#### Interactive CV

This was built using the `react-slider` library.

#### Skills Searcher

This is put together using a combination of `react-table` and `react-autosuggest`.

#### Drag and Drop Jigsaw

This is a demo I made using the `react-dnd` library. I used one of the demos from their docs as a starting point. Getting it to look even halfway decent on mobile screens was a challenge...

#### Whack a Mole!

The original code for this was taken from the Wes Bos [JavaScript 30 course](https://github.com/wesbos/JavaScript30). I converted this from vanilla javascript into a React app. I also added some additional functionality and added mobile some addtional styles.

#### Enter the Matrix

This was originally a [JS1K competition](http://js1k.com/2013-spring/demo/1382) entry by Pedro Franceschi. I take no credit for the algorithm! I took the minified and then re-wrote it to work as a React app. I also added a little more functionality for fun.

#### Redux Todo App

This is an app that anyone who has learned Redux has done... The original code can be found [here](https://redux.js.org/basics/example). I just wanted to demonstrate that Redux was working properly in the site!
